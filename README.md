AlphaGardenSim
-------

AlphaGardenSim is a fast, first order open-access simulator that integrates single plant growth models with inter-plant 
competition for sun light and water. The simulation builds up on [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) and implements an 
environment for polyculture farming. More on the simulator can be found in our [paper]().
