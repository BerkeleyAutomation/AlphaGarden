	- gym env, wrapper interface

1. 2x2 grid, learns not to water. penalize water heavily and don't actually irrigate
	v get consistent results
2. If we pass 1, look at dynamics bwtn crop yield and penalty
 	- learning rate, batch size, crop lambda, water lambda 
3. Investigate policy after training
	v format predict.json
	v have all files from 1 experiment in the same folder
4.meet later this week.  Look at results from experiments, clean workflow
