# alphagarden.org

> deployed on Rieff under [Jackson's Domain Name](rieff.jacksonchui.ai) (04.12.2020)

### Starting up the website (i.e. interactive web app)

In your desired directory, `git clone https://github.com/BerkeleyAutomation/AlphaGarden.git && cd AlphaGarden/WebApp/ && npm install && npm start`. It should start the app at `localhost:3001`.

Our server is [Rieff](rieff.ieor.berkeley.edu). We are running it like Heroku does and just using npm start with port forwarding (you can find this out from the information about the server). If there are any questions ask anyone who is a contributor to the project and they can get you in touch with the right people.


## Other Logistics

The `WebApp` branch contains the correct version of the website that we are rolling out as an exhibition.
